SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
David does not share Personal Information collected from your use of the David Service with others, except as described in this Privacy Policy.

David may share your Personal Information when you have authorized David to do so, when it is necessary to complete a transaction, to operate or improve the David Service or to take some action that you have asked us to do.

David will share your email address with companies that use the David Service when you authorize David to do so. How such companies use your email address is subject to those companies’ own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy.

David may share your personal information with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to David, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

David may share Personal Information under the following circumstances:
In the course of operating our business, it may be necessary or appropriate for us to provide access to your Personal Information to others such as our service providers, contractors and select vendors so that we can operate the David Service and our business. Where practical, we seek to obtain confidentiality agreements that are consistent with this Privacy Policy and that limit others’ use or disclosure of this Personal Information.
We may share your Personal Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims or in such circumstances where, in our judgment, disclosure is required or appropriate.
We may share your Personal Information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our various terms of service or as otherwise required by law.
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell all or part of our business. In such transactions, Personal Information collected from users is generally one of the business assets that will be transferred. The transferred Personal Information will remain subject to this Privacy Policy or subsequent policies to which you have consented.

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, or specifically reject cookies set by David, you may not be able to take full advantage of features of the David Service that require you to be signed in to your account or otherwise identify yourself.

INFORMATION RELATING TO CHILDREN
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are a minor under 18, we recommend you to register or attempt to register for any of our products, services, websites and applications or send any of your personal information to us if and only if you have acquired prior consent from a person with parental responsibilities for you, such as your parents. David does not take any steps to verify the age you have provided us.

If you believe that we might have collected Personal Information from your minor whom you have parental responsibility with and would like to request us to delete the personal information of your minor, please contact us.

DATA WE COLLECT OTHER THAN PERSONAL INFORMATION
In addition to Personal Information, we collect data on your use and interaction with the David Service. Data which we obtain about you, other than Personal Information, is the exclusive property of David and may be used by David in any manner permitted by applicable laws.

RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA
David reserves the right to retain your Personal Information, other data collected about you and content you submit to or through the David Service to the extent required by applicable laws, rules and regulations and as reasonably necessary to protect our legal interests and operate our business.

David will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will take all practicable steps to ensure that your personal information is not kept longer than is necessary.

DATA TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE
No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.

David uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the David Service. Where practical, we seek to obtain confidentiality agreements that are consistent with this Privacy Policy and that limit others’ use or disclosure of your Personal Information but we would not disclose the agreements.

ACCESS AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Your personal information will be kept in our database for a reasonable period. If you are the subject of the personal information, you have the right to check whether we hold your personal information, to obtain a copy of such information and to correct any related information which is inaccurate or outdated.

You may also request to delete your personal information. However, David aims to maintain our services in a manner that protects your personal information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you have deleted your personal information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and remove information from our backup systems. David will remove the information you have deleted within reasonable time if such information is no longer necessary for the fulfilment of the purposes for which the information is used. If you have request, please send us.

When updating or deleting your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

David may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).

INTERNATIONAL USE
The David Service is hosted in Hong Kong. If you use the David Service from outside of Hong Kong, you acknowledge that you are voluntarily transferring information (potentially including Personal Information) to Hong Kong and agree that David’ collection, use, storage and sharing of your information is exclusively subject to the laws of Hong Kong, not of the jurisdiction in which you are located.

CHANGES AND UPDATES
We continue to update this Privacy Policy as a life document. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the Personal Information we collect. Your continued use of this David Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.
